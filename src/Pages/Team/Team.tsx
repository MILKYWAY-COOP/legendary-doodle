      <h1>Our Team</h1>
      <p>
        A team of well-wishers provides 24-hour care for the kids at Koimbi
        Children's Home. This team is responsible for many different things.
        They include, but are not limited to, picking up and dropping off kids
        at school, assisting with schoolwork, preparing meals, and creating an
        atmosphere that values respect, accountability, and empowerment.

        It takes a lot of discipline, love, patience, and compassion to be a
        team member. Although it may seem easy, providing love, care, and
        encouragement for these young ones is one of the most difficult aspect
        of our work. There are various challenges involved in taking in and
        caring for abused and neglected children. Some of them have been the
        “mom” or “dad” to younger siblings. Many kids have never experienced
        love or even understood what love truly is, while others have have never
        never had life-rules or structure. It takes time, effort, and patience
        to win their trust; it is merely the beginning of a long process with
        these kids. It is beyond rewarding to be able to participate in their
        lives. Being a Team Member is rewarding since they get to contribute in
        some tangible way to their success. We can say with confidence that our
        team is made up of a remarkable group of committed, strong, and
        compassionate individuals who give their all to enhancing the lives of
        the kids in our care. We are incredibly grateful for everything they do.
